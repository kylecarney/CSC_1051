variables: doAgain, year, initialInvestment, targetValue, interestRate, balance, interest

algorithm:

doAgain = 1
year = 1  

while (doAgain = 1)

   print enter initial investment
   input initial investment

   print enter target value
   input target value

   print enter interest rate
   input interest rate

   print starting balance & interest rate

   print table header with "year", "interest", and "balance"
   
   interest = initialInvestment * (interestRate / 100)
   balance = interest + initialInvestment
   
   print values for year, interest, and balance

   while (balance < target)
      year++
      initialInvestment = balance;
      interest = initialInvestment * (interestRate/100);
      balance = interest + balance;
      print year, interest, and balance
   
print do another?
year = 1
input yes or no
